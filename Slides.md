# The IO package

* contains basic, widely used interfaces (within and outside standard library)
* simple, flexible helpers

----

# Why beautiful?

> La bellezza Ã¨ negli occhi di chi guarda

* io.Reader and io.Writer are single method interfaces, with dozens of implementations
* stackable, composable
* reminiscent of UNIX pipes, where a byte stream (text) serves as the universal interface
