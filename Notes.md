# Notes

## General things about speaking on technical topics

* keep it applied
* the good parts
* context and curation

## Key points

* work with various kinds of data
* like the concept of small interfaces
* there are love letters out there
* how to write your own
* how are they actually used, in which contexts
* can the IO interfaces teach us a bit about composition

## Code snippets

* [ ] interfaces
* [ ] CopyBuffer performance, and CPU
* [ ] ReaderFrom performance, and allocation difference
